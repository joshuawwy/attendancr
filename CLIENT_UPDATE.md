# Attendancr - Project Update

## What We've Built

Attendancr is a simple check-in system for your tuition centre. It runs on any device with a web browser - tablets, phones, or computers.

### How It Works

**For Staff:**
1. Staff enter their 6-digit PIN to log in
2. Search for a student by name
3. Tap to check them in
4. Parents automatically receive a notification on Telegram

**For Parents:**
- Receive instant Telegram messages when their child checks in
- Message includes student name, time, and which staff member checked them in

**For Admins:**
- View all attendance records
- Filter by date
- See which staff checked in which students
- Generate Telegram links to send to parents

## What's Next (Phase 2)

**Google Sheets Integration**
- Import student and parent data from a Google Sheet
- Keep the sheet private and secure
- Sync changes automatically

This means you can manage your student list in Google Sheets (add new students, update parent contacts) and the app will stay up to date.

## Getting Started

To start using the system, we need to:

1. **Set up staff PINs** - Create PIN codes for each staff member
2. **Add students** - Either manually or via Google Sheets sync
3. **Invite parents** - Send them Telegram links to receive notifications

Let me know when you'd like to proceed with setup!
